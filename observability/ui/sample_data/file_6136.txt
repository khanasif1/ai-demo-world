Topic: Cloud Computing

Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources and services over the internet. It enables businesses to scale applications, store large amounts of data, and deploy services without needing to maintain physical infrastructure. Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud offer various services, including infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). Organizations benefit from reduced costs, increased flexibility, and enhanced collaboration through cloud-based solutions. Security and data privacy remain key concerns in cloud computing, leading to innovations in encryption, access control, and compliance measures. As more enterprises embrace multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud strategies, the future of cloud computing will focus on interoperability, sustainability, and AI-driven automation.
